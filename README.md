barry
=====

`barry` is a 2D side-scrolling shooter made with [löve](http://love2d.org/).

Install löve, then clone the repo and run `bundle.sh`; it will give you a
.love executable.

It's not an actual game yet; it is but it's not fun. Maybe it will be
at some point.

Features:

* Some weapons (change with shift)
* Some enemies (game becomes unplayable soon)
* Gamepad support

More stuff to come.
